# epfml-text-classification
EPFL ML 2016 Project 2: Michael, Sylvain, Mohammad 

To run the files present in our project, you will need to install some requierments.

The main model is produced using Keras which is a high-level library for neural networks Python and it runs on top of either TensorFlow or Theano. 
In our case, we used it on the top of TensorFlow. We can simply install Keras by following these instructions : https://keras.io/#installation

Another important point, if you want to run the training of the model, you need to have the stop words from the nltk package. In order to get those,
you just have to type nltk.download() in Python and then download the package named stopwords under the all package tab.

TODO : - More detailed instructions
       - Explain the role of each file in the folder
       - Briefly explain the final model maybe ???
